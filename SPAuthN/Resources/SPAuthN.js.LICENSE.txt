/**
     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method

     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:

To use the validator call the validate function with an instance object and an optional schema object.
If a schema is provided, it will be used to validate. If the instance object refers to a schema (self-validating),
that schema will be used to validate and the schema parameter is not necessary (if both exist,
both validations will occur).
The validate method will return an array of validation errors. If there are no errors, then an
empty list will be returned. A validation error will have two properties:
"property" which indicates which property had the error
"message" which indicates what the error was
